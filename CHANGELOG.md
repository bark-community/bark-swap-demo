# Changelog

All notable changes to the BarkSwap DApp project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1]

1. **Improved Script Loading:** Refactored the script loading process to improve efficiency and error handling. Now, the script is loaded asynchronously, and appropriate error handling is implemented for failed script loading.

2. **Loading Indicator:** Added a loading indicator to provide visual feedback to users while the Jupiter script is being loaded. This indicator improves the user experience by indicating that the page is still loading.

3. **Code Cleanup:** Removed redundant code and optimized the useEffect hook dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders and ensure efficient execution of code.

4. **Error Handling:** Enhanced error handling mechanisms to handle script loading failures more gracefully. Errors are now logged to the console with descriptive messages to aid in debugging.

5. **Refactored Script Initialization:** The initialization process for Jupiter is refactored to ensure smooth integration and to handle any potential errors that may occur during initialization.

6. **Documentation:** Updated code comments and added descriptive comments where necessary to improve code readability and maintainability.

7. **CSS Styles:** Ensured consistency and adherence to project styles by using CSS modules for styling components.

8. **Dependencies:** Verified and updated package dependencies to ensure compatibility and security compliance.

This change log summarizes the improvements made to the Page component, focusing on script loading, error handling, user experience enhancements, and code cleanliness.
